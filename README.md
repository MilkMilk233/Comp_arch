# Overview

This repository stores all my codes, notes and relevant materials for CSC3050, 2022 Spring. Basically, I enjoy this course very much (Except for the assignment description, which bothers me a lot). 

The lecture is given by Prof. Wang FX. I **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** attending his courses because he is one of the best lecturers I have ever met so far in this university from the lecture quality aspect.

In the assignments, full marks and bonus are attained except for 2 points deduction in the report of Assignment1. All the materials are for reference only. If you think sharing the course material is inappropriate, please email me at zhixinchen@link.cuhk.edu.cn.

Wish all of you can be a great engineer and good luck! 0v0

*Recommended Prerequisites: EIE2050 + CSC3002*
