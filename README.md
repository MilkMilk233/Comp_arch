# Overview

This repository stores all my codes, notes and relevant materials in CSC3050, 2022 Spring. Basically, I enjoy this course very much (Except for the assignment description, which bothers me a lot). 

The lecture is given by Prof. Wang FX. I **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** attending his courses because he is one of the best lecturers I have ever met so far in this university from the lecture quality aspect.

In the assignments, full marks are attained except for 2 points deduction in the report of Assignment1. All the materials are for reference only. Plagiarism is against the academic honesty, so think before twice. If you think it's inappropriate to share the course material, please email me at zhixinchen@link.cuhk.edu.cn.

Wish all of you be a great engineer and good luck! 0v0
